<p><strong>Who can take the vaccine?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The vaccine is safe and effective for all individuals aged 6 months and above. In line with the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.who.int/publications-detail-redirect/WHO-2019-nCoV-Vaccines-SAGE-Prioritization-2022.1">WHO Prioritization Roadmap</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.who.int/publications-detail-redirect/who-sage-values-framework-for-the-allocation-and-prioritization-of-covid-19-vaccination">WHO Values Framework</a>, older adults, immunocompromised persons and health workers are the highest priority-use groups. All efforts should be taken to achieve high vaccine coverage rates in the highest and high priority-use groups.&nbsp;<br><strong></strong></p>

<h3>Should pregnant and breastfeeding women be vaccinated?</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Given the adverse consequences of COVID-19 disease during pregnancy and the increasing data supporting a favorable safety profile of BNT162b2 in pregnancy, WHO recommends the use of BNT162b2 in pregnant individuals. WHO does not recommend pregnancy testing prior to vaccination. WHO does not recommend delaying pregnancy or terminating pregnancy because of vaccination.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Vaccine effectiveness is expected to be similar in breastfeeding women as in other adults. WHO recommends the use of the vaccine in breastfeeding women as in other adults. WHO does not recommend discontinuing breastfeeding because of vaccination.&nbsp;Vaccine-elicited antibodies have been found in breast milk following vaccination of breastfeeding women, suggesting possible neonatal as well as maternal protection.</p>

<h3>Who should not take the vaccine?</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>People with a history of severe allergic reaction to any component of the vaccine should not take it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Anyone with fever (body temperature over 38.5 ÂºC) should postpone vaccination until they are afebrile.</p>

<h3>Is this vaccine recommended for children and adolescents?</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This vaccine is authorized for use for those aged 6 months and older, with an adjustment in the recommended dosage for those aged 6 months to 4 years, and an adjustment for those aged 5-11 years.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>WHO recommends that countries should consider using the vaccine in children aged 6 months and older to 17 only when high vaccine coverage with 2 doses has been achieved in the highest and high priority-use groups as identified in the WHO Prioritization Roadmap.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Children and adolescents aged 6 months - 17 years of age with comorbidities that put them at significantly higher risk of serious COVID-19 disease, should be offered vaccination, alongside other high-risk groups.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In accordance with the WHO Prioritization Roadmap, the priority remains to prevent deaths by achieving high vaccine coverage (primary series and boosters) in the highest and high priority-use groups.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In general, children are at lower risk of COVID-19. That is why WHO recommend that countries prioritize vaccinating people who have higher risk first, like people who are older, have existing health conditions and health workers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety (GACVS), a group of experts that provides independent and authoritative guidance to WHO on the topic of safe vaccine use, receives and assesses reports of suspected safety events of potentially international impact. In October 2021, the GACVS COVID-19 subcommittee concluded that the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines have clear benefits in all age groups in reducing hospitalizations and deaths due to COVID-19.</p>

<p>A very rare serious adverse event is myocarditis, which is mainly observed in young males aged 18-35 after the second dose. &nbsp;These myocarditis cases typically occurred within a few days after vaccination, are generally mild, respond to conservative treatment, and are less severe with better outcomes than classical myocarditis or COVID-19 related myocarditis.</p>

<h3>How efficacious is the vaccine?</h3>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Pfizer BioNTech vaccine against COVID-19 has very high efficacy against severe disease and moderate efficacy against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection.<br></p>
